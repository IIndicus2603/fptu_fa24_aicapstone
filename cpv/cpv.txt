3.Photometric image formation

*Present the effect of illumination and light source?
Illumination and light sources have a significant impact on how we perceive images. The angle and intensity of light sources can change how objects appear in an image, creating shadows, highlights, and reflections. Illumination can also impact the color and texture of objects, making them appear brighter or darker.

*What are the reflectance and shading models?
Reflectance models are used to describe how light interacts with surfaces. They calculate how much light is reflected off an object, and how the angle of incidence affects the reflection. Shading models are used to calculate how light and shadow are represented in an image. They take into account factors such as the angle of light, surface orientation, and surface roughness.

*What is the pinhole model?
The pinhole model is a simple mathematical model used in computer vision to describe the relationship between a camera and an image. It assumes that light travels through a small pinhole in the camera and forms an inverted image on a plane behind the pinhole. The pinhole model helps to explain the distortion that occurs in images due to the curvature of the camera lens and other factors. It is often used as a basis for more complex camera models in computer vision.

4.The Digital Camera
*Present the construction of a camera to create digital images?
A digital camera consists of several components, including a lens to focus light onto a sensor, a sensor to convert light into electrical signals, and an image processor to convert the electrical signals into a digital image. The lens focuses light onto the sensor, which is made up of millions of photosites that capture light and convert it into electrical signals. The image processor then takes these signals and applies various corrections and enhancements to create a digital image.

*What is the difference between color systems, and color spaces?
Color systems and color spaces are both used to describe colors, but they are different concepts. A color system is a set of rules or conventions for representing colors numerically.

Correlation is a measure of similarity between two signals, and convolution is a mathematical operation that combines two signals to produce a third signal. In image filtering, correlation and convolution are used interchangeably, but convolution is more commonly used.
*How linear filters work and their implementation?
Linear filters work by convolving the image with a linear kernel. The kernel is moved over the image, and at each location, the convolution operation is performed by multiplying the kernel with the corresponding pixel values in the image. This results in a new value for the pixel at the center of the kernel, and this value is stored in a new image.
*How nonlinear filters work and their implementation?
Nonlinear filters work by applying a nonlinear function to the neighboring pixels within a specific window. The function applied depends on the values of the neighboring pixels, and it can be used to remove noise, blur or sharpen the image, or enhance edges. Examples of nonlinear filters include median filters, max filters, and min filters. The implementation of a nonlinear filter involves applying the kernel to each pixel in the image and calculating the output value using the nonlinear function.
